### Hello There!

This is my first post here. I plan to use this site as somewhat of a blog, but also as a place to record notes that I otherwise would stash away in some digital shoebox.

&nbsp;

Here's a bit of information on how I put this site together, and some of the inspiration I pulled from for its design:

**Host**: [*Github Pages*](https://pages.github.com)

**Jekyll template**: [*Maxime Vaillancourt's Digital Garden Template*](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)

**Color scheme**: [*Steph Ango's Flexoki*](https://stephango.com/flexoki)

**Other general layout and content inspiration**:
* [*Tomas McGuinness's blog*](https://tomasmcguinness.com)
